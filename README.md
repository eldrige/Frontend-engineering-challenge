# Frontend Engineering Challenge

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

## Tech Stack

The following tools were used:

### `Apollo Client`

Apollo client's API is easy to use, and supports many use cases for working with GraphQl api's. Hooks like useQuery and useLazyQuery are used to make queries and mutations.

### `Tailwind`

Tailwind provides a quick way to write css without ever leaving HTML, and it provides users with great developer experience.


### `Country GraphQL API`

In other to simplify the process of choosing an API, I choose the  [GraphQL Country API](https://graphql.country/graphql) because it covers both the filter and search use cases of the challenge.

### `Website Preview`

You can access the website directly here [Countries GQL-API](https://62ce03a678330203d7018234--tubular-truffle-f32ea4.netlify.app/),
